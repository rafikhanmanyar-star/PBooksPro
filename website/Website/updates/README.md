# Electron Auto-Update Files

This directory hosts the update files for the PBooks Pro desktop app.
Render serves these as static files, and the Electron `autoUpdater` fetches them.

## Required files after each release build

- `latest.yml` -- Generated by electron-builder (contains version, sha512, file name)
- `PBooks Pro Setup X.Y.Z.exe` -- The NSIS installer

## How to publish an update

1. Bump version in `package.json`
2. Run `npm run electron:production:installer`
3. Copy `release/latest.yml` and `release/PBooks Pro Setup X.Y.Z.exe` into this folder
4. Commit and push to `main`
5. Render auto-deploys the static site; existing installations will detect the update
