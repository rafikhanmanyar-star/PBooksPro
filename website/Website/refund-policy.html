                <p>All refund requests will be reviewed by our support team. We may contact you for additional information to better understand your situation and to ensure we can improve our product based on your feedback.</p>

                    <li>You will receive an email confirmation once the refund has been processed</li>

                <h2>7. License Revocation</h2>

                    <li>Delete any copies of the software in your possession</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Continued use of the software after a refund has been processed may result in legal action.</p>

                <h2>8. Partial Refunds</h2>
                <p>In certain circumstances, we may offer partial refunds instead of full refunds. This may occur if:</p>
                <ul class="legal-list">
                    <li>The software has been used for a significant period before the refund request</li>

                    <li>You have received value from support services or training</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Any partial refund offer will be clearly communicated to you before processing.</p>

                <h2>9. Chargebacks</h2>
                <p>If you initiate a chargeback through your bank or credit card company instead of contacting us directly, we reserve the right to dispute the chargeback and provide evidence of the purchase and our refund policy. We encourage you to contact us first to resolve any issues, as we are committed to finding a fair solution.</p>

                <h2>10. Special Circumstances</h2>
                <p>We understand that special circumstances may arise. If you believe your situation warrants special consideration, please contact us with details. We will review each case individually and may make exceptions to our standard refund policy at our discretion.</p>

                <h2>11. Currency and Exchange Rates</h2>
                <p>Refunds will be processed in the same currency as the original purchase. If currency exchange rates have changed between the purchase date and refund date, the refund amount may differ slightly due to exchange rate fluctuations. We are not responsible for any differences caused by exchange rate changes.</p>
