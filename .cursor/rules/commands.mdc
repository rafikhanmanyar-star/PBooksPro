# PBooks Pro – Commands

## Deploy to Staging

```powershell
npm run deploy:staging
# or: .\deploy-staging.ps1
```

**What it does (in order):**
1. Increments patch version (e.g. 1.2.2 → 1.2.3)
2. Builds electron staging installer → `release-staging/`
3. Copies `latest.yml` to `server/updates/` and `website/Website/updates/` (for auto-update)
4. Registers release in `server/releases/releases.json` and uploads to GitHub Releases (if `gh` CLI available)
5. Stages and commits all changes
6. Pushes to remote `staging` branch ONLY → triggers Render staging auto-deploy

**Render staging services redeployed:**
- `pbookspro-api-staging` (API server)
- `pbookspro-admin-staging` (Admin portal)
- `pbookspro-website-staging` (Website)

# or: .\deploy-production.ps1
```

4. Registers release in `server/releases/releases.json` and uploads to GitHub Releases (if `gh` CLI available)
5. Stages and commits all changes
6. Pushes to remote `staging` branch (keeps staging in sync)
