# Fixing Issues in Existing Flow/Feature

Use this rule when debugging or fixing bugs in current behavior (not when adding new features).

## Approach for Fixes

1. **Gather context** – Reproduce or understand the issue (symptoms, steps, env).
2. **Locate the flow** – Find the code paths involved (UI, API, DB, tenant context).
3. **Identify root cause** – Don’t only fix symptoms; find why it fails.
4. **Minimal change** – Prefer the smallest change that fixes the bug and keeps existing behavior.
5. **Respect conventions** – Follow project-conventions (tenant_id, imports, migrations, etc.).

## Sample Prompts (copy and customize)

**Generic fix**
- *"Fix the issue where [describe what goes wrong]. Steps: [how to reproduce]. Expected: [what should happen]."*

**Flow/feature broken**
- *"The [feature name] flow is broken: when I [action], [actual result]. It should [expected result]. Please find the cause and fix with minimal changes."*

**After a recent change**
- *"After [recent change], [specific behavior] no longer works. Please fix the regression in the [area/flow]."*

**Vague symptom**
- *"Something is wrong with [feature/flow]. [Error message or symptom]. Help me locate the cause and fix it."*

**With file/area hint**
- *"Fix the bug in [file or area]: [what’s wrong]. Keep the rest of the flow unchanged."*

**Multi-step flow**
- *"The flow from [step A] to [step B] fails because [symptom]. Trace the code path and fix the issue."*

**API/backend**
- *"The [endpoint/action] returns [wrong response/error] when [conditions]. Fix the server-side logic."*

**Tenant/data**
- *"Data is wrong when [scenario]: [what’s wrong]. Check tenant context and queries; fix with minimal change."*

## When Asking

- Mention **where** it fails (screen, API, DB) if you know.
- Include **repro steps** and **expected vs actual** when possible.
- Reference **files or components** if you’ve already narrowed it down.
